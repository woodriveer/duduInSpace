# Project Context

## Purpose
This project is to create a spaceship arcade game for my son. 
Dudu had always been a curious and very intelligent child. Since he was little, he loved looking at the stars and imagining what it would be like to explore the universe. But he never imagined that, one day, Earth would really need him!

On a quiet night, while observing the sky with his telescope, Dudu noticed something strange: a shower of giant asteroids was approaching the planet. Scientists were desperate—there wasn't time to send a space mission. Humanity needed a hero... and that hero was Dudu!

With his brilliant mind and incredible skills, he rushes to his secret spaceship—a project he had been building in his backyard. Powered by advanced technology and equipped with plasma beam cannons, this ship was the only hope to save the planet.

Now, Dudu must traverse space, dodge debris, and destroy the asteroids before they hit Earth. But is this mission really that simple? Or is there something darker behind this asteroid shower?
The adventure is just beginning... 🌠

this game should have multiples levels, each level has different difficulty and different enemy.

## Tech Stack
- Kotlin
- Gdx (libGDX)


## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Solid principles
- Clean code
- For literal text and numbers to define default values for variables, I like to use companion objects with `const val`

### Architecture Patterns
- Clean Architecture

### Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests

### Git Workflow
- feature branch for example `feature/1-asteroid`
    - the number in the front of branch is the issue on github related to the feature.
    - the feature branch is created from the main branch.
    - the feature branch is merged to the main branch.
        - feature branch can only be merged after pipeline get success.
    - the feature branch is deleted.
- main branch
- release branch
- hotfix branch
